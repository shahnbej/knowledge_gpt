This will allow us to ask questions about our documents (that were not included in the training data), without fine-tunning the Large Language Model (LLM).\nWhen using RAG, if you are given a question, you first do a retrieval step to fetch any relevant documents from a special database, a vector database where these documents were indexed. \nThe data that we will use is the text of EU AI Act, approved on March 13, 2024.\n\n## Definitions\n\n* LLM - Large Language Model  \n* Llama3- LLM from Meta \n* Langchain - a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLMs\n* Vector database - a database that organizes data through high-dimmensional vectors  \n* ChromaDB - vector database  \n* RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation (see below more details about RAGs)\n\n## Model details\n\n* **Model**: Llama 3  \n* **Variation**: 8b-chat-hf  (8b: 8B dimm.; hf: HuggingFace)\n* **Version**: V1  \n* **Framework**: Transformers  \n\nLlama3 model is pretrained and fine-tuned with 15T+ (more than 15 Trillion) tokens and 8 to 70 Billion parameters which makes it one of the powerful open source models. It is a highly improvement over Llama2 model.\n\n\n## What is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system?\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) has proven their ability to understand context and provide accurate answers to various NLP tasks, including summarization, Q&A, when prompted. While being able to provide very good answers to questions about information that they were trained with, they tend to hallucinate when the topic is about information that they do \"not know\", i.e. was not included in their training data. Retrieval Augmented Generation combines external resources with LLMs. The main two components of a RAG are therefore a retriever and a generator.  \n \nThe retriever part can be described as a system that is able to encode our data so that can be easily retrieved the relevant parts of it upon queriying it. The encoding is done using text embeddings, i.e. a model trained to create a vector representation of the information. The best option for implementing a retriever is a vector database. As vector database, there are multiple options, both open source or commercial products. Few examples are ChromaDB, Mevius, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate. Our option in this Notebook will be a local instance of ChromaDB (persistent).\n\nFor the generator part, the obvious option is a LLM. In this Notebook we will use a quantized Llama3 model, from the Kaggle Models collection.  \n\nThe orchestration of the retriever and generator will be done using Langchain. A specialized function from Langchain allows us to create the receiver-generator in one line of code.\n\n## The data \n\nThe data that will be indexed in the vector database to make it searchable by the RAG system is the complete text of the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act. This is a European Union regulation on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the European Union. Proposed by the European Commission on 21 April 2021, it was adopted on 13 March 2024.

What are the implications of this act for the tech industry and society at large?\nThe EU AI Act, officially known as the Regulation on a Framework for the Conditions of High-Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence (EU AI Act), is a proposed regulation aimed at ensuring the trustworthy development, deployment, and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the European Union. The act is part of the EU's efforts to promote the safe and responsible development of AI, while also ensuring the protection of citizens' rights and fundamental values.\n\nMain goals and objectives:\n\n1. **Trustworthy AI**: The EU AI Act aims to ensure that AI systems are trustworthy, transparent, and explainable, with a focus on preventing biases and ensuring fairness.\n2. **Risk management**: The regulation seeks to identify and mitigate risks associated with AI, such as job displacement, privacy concerns, and potential biases.\n3. **Standardization**: The EU AI Act aims to establish common standards for AI development, deployment, and use, ensuring consistency across the EU.\n4. **Accountability**: The regulation requires AI developers and users to be accountable for the consequences of their AI systems.\n\nImplications for the tech industry and society:\n\n1. **Increased transparency**: The EU AI Act will require AI developers to provide clear explanations of their AI systems' decision-making processes, increasing transparency and accountability.\n2. **Responsible innovation**: The regulation will encourage responsible innovation in AI, promoting the development of AI systems that are fair, transparent, and explainable.\n3. **Job displacement concerns**: The EU AI Act may lead to increased job displacement concerns, as AI systems may replace certain jobs, potentially exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.\n4. **Data protection**: The regulation will strengthen data protection rules, ensuring that AI systems handle personal data responsibly and in accordance with EU data protection regulations.\n5. **Increased costs**: The EU AI Act may lead to increased costs for AI developers and users, as they will need to comply with the regulation's requirements and implement necessary measures to ensure trustworthy AI development and deployment.\n\nOverall, the EU AI Act aims to promote the safe and responsible development of AI, while also ensuring the protection of citizens' rights and fundamental values.

While it may present challenges for the tech industry, it is an important step towards ensuring that AI benefits society as a whole.assistant\n\nThe EU AI Act is a proposed regulation aimed at ensuring the trustworthy development, deployment, and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the European Union.
